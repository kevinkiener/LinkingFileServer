# LinkingFileServer
The purpose of this program is to link urls to folders and files.
The default url for accessing your files will look something like http://localhost:3030/Test/Path/info.pdf.
## Features
### Default Path
In the tool the default path has to be set and can be changed via the gui or the config.json file.

The default path can also contain path variables as shown in the screenshot.
### Converting File Paths to URL
The URL can only be created if the path to convert contains the default path.

There are multiple options, the path in the clipboard can directly be converted to the url required to open the file later.
To do this right click on the tray icon and select "Convert Clipboard to Path". This will replace the clipboard with the new path.
The other option is to use the gui that opens with "Convert Path".

This opens the window where you can convert it and see the new path immediately.
